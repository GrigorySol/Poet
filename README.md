# Poet

Poet is an RNN based model with the ability to make it's own poems. Here are a couple of examples.

### Troye Sivan

```
Love me down the boulevard
now let's face what all the talk's about 
other to fall don't heal aerosol
```

### Robert Frost

```
River from the kitchen to the bedroom
for the height it was none time
by what were it are
```

To make it work better, change the number of units in the LSTM or add more layers to make a more sophisticated RNN.
We can even add more data to make the model produce better results.
